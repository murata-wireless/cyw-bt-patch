THE FOLLOWING NOTES APPLY ONCE THE YOCTO LINUX IMAGE IS BUILT AND ROOTFS IS POPULATED:
======================================================================================
Use "murata-master" sub-folder for module-specific Bluetooth patchfiles. When executing "hciattach" in Linux, the BlueZ stack queries 
the BT core for a chip ID (over UART connection) which it uses for loading the corresponding Bluetoothpatchfile from "/etc/firmware" folder. 

NOTE: this Bluetooth patchfiles (*.hcd) are intended as reference only. The user needs to customize the Bluetooth patchfile to meet their HW/SW system requirements.
